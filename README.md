# Land Use and Land Cover Classification from Medium-Resolution Imagery Using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks

This repository provides a comprehensive guide on performing Land Use and Land Cover (LULC)  classification on Sentinel-2 multispectral images using finely-tuned Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The entire workflow involves training an efficiently optimized CNN model and subsequently applying the pre-trained model to map Land Use and Land Cover in Sentinel-2 imagery.


## Key Features

## Google Colab Pro Environment
The entire implementation is carried out using Python programming within the Google Colab Pro environment, ensuring accessibility and ease of use.

## Well- Optimized CNNs
State-of-the-art, well-optimized CNNs with fixed hyperparameters for Sentinel-2 imagery are employed to achieve accurate and efficient Land Use and Land Cover classification

## Keras Deep Learning Library
Keras Deep Learning Library: CNNs are implemented using the Keras open-source Deep Learning library, known for its user-friendly API and powerful capabilities
